# Tic Tac Toe Game with IPC (Inter Process Communication) Implementation

## By: HaallooBim

## Description

This repository contains an implementation of IPC (Inter-Process Communication) in a basic Tic Tac Toe game that allows data communication across several processes. In this program, I implemented Shared Memory and Message Queue to enable this functionality. Have Fun!! ^^

## How to Run Program

1. Clone this repository to your linux machine and move to that directory.<br>
 _*It would be preferable to run the program on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) exclusively. The program has been tested solely on WSL for optimal functionality and compatibility._

```git
git clone https://github.com/Haalloobim/Tic-Tac-Toe_IPC-Implematation.git tic-tac-toe && cd tic-tac-toe
```

2. Open 3 different terminal

3. In the first terminal run the [game.c](./game.c) with this command. 

```sh
./run game
```

4. In the second and third terminal, run the [player.c](./player.c) with this command.

```sh
./run player
```

5. Enjoy your tic tac toe game.
